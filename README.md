This project is an end-to-end AI-powered Business Intelligence system.

It uses:
- Python for data processing and analytics
- SQLite as a data warehouse
- Power BI for dashboards
- A Large Language Model (LLM) to generate business insights automatically

The LLM analyzes key metrics like revenue, orders, and delivery time and produces
executive-level recommendations that are shown inside the dashboard.
